Challange: Advent of code 2015.
    Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. 
    He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.
    
    An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

    For example:

            (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
            ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
            ))((((( also results in floor 3.
            ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
            ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.


    To what floor do the instructions take Santa?

 ----SOLUTION----

    input - .txt file 
    output - integer number of floor

    <Steps>
    1. Display document in console.
    2. Save content in variable as string
    3. Loop throw the length of string and count '(' and ')'
    4. Subtract numbers and output the answer

const fileSystem = require('fs');

let upFloor = 0;
let downFloor = 0;

fileSystem.readFile(__dirname +'/sample.txt', (err, fd)=> {
    if (err) throw err;
    const file = (fd.toString());
    
    file.split('').forEach((value)=> {
        value === '(' ? upFloor++ :downFloor++;
})

    console.log('Floor', upFloor - downFloor);
});
